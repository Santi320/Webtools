        <h3>This Page Content</h3>
        <p>
          This is a sample page to demonstrate some of the concepts related to the assignments in the web development class. 
          I acquired much of the information about my avatar from Wikipedia. All I had to do was copy, paste, and clean up the odd notations. 
          Wikipedia has a fair use policy allowing us to use their content. Thanks, Wikipedia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your first pages in the class should only have HTML tags as instructed in the assignment. 
          The goal is to begin with well-formed, standards-compliant code. You should not add any images, CSS styles, or JavaScript at this time.

        <h3>Your Pages</h3>
        <p>
          The pages for your site should have content about your avatar. Each student needs to create their own unique site. 
          Please do not copy/paste others' code without significant changes. It is allowed for you to use the sample code from 
          the instructor's notes to give you a start, but you must embellish the code and add content specific to your project. 
          Simple copy/paste without significant changes will result in a diminished grade.

        <h4>The Easter Bunny</h4>
        <p>
          The Easter Bunny (also called the Easter Rabbit or Easter Hare) is a folkloric figure and symbol of Easter, 
          depicted as a rabbit—sometimes dressed in clothes—bringing Easter eggs. Originating among German Lutherans, 
          the "Easter Hare" originally played the role of a judge, evaluating whether children were good or disobedient in behavior 
          at the start of Eastertide, similar to Santa’s "naughty or nice" list. As part of the legend, the creature carries 
          colored eggs, candy, and sometimes toys to children’s homes. This custom was first mentioned in Georg Franck von Franckenau's 
          De ovis paschalibus ('About Easter eggs') in 1682.

        <h5>Rabbits and Hares</h5>
        <p>
          The hare was a popular motif in medieval church art. Ancient writers like Pliny and Plutarch believed the hare was 
          a hermaphrodite; this led to an association with the Virgin Mary. Hares appear in illuminated manuscripts and Northern 
          European paintings of the Virgin and Christ Child, and sometimes in the three hares motif symbolizing the Trinity.

        <h3>Eggs</h3>
        <p>
          Eggs have symbolized fertility since antiquity and were tied to Christian rebirth early on. During medieval Lent, 
          eggs were forbidden, so children begged for them on the Saturday before the fast; they then celebrated by decorating and eating them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a special dish, eggs would be decorated with flowers to bring spring indoors. German Protestants retained the custom 
          of colored eggs, and Eastern Orthodox Christians still dye eggs red for Christ’s blood. The Ukrainian art of pysanky predates 
          Christianity and survives today across Eastern Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Osterhase" tradition arrived in the U.S. with 18th-century Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants. Hase means "hare" in German, 
          and good children found colored eggs in the nests they made before Easter.

      <h2>In Summary</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Enough Content</h3>
        <p>
          You need enough content to thoroughly populate your page so it scrolls. Keep copying and pasting from Wikipedia until 
          you have a scrolling page—later you’ll embellish it with styles, colors, and layouts.
