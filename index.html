      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>My name is Angel Negrete, and my favorite hobbies are watching youtube, working on cars, and trying out new foods.</p>
      <p>I love to work on cars ever since I was a baby my dad would take me with him to work on cars and hes told me and showed me videos of me asking him what every part does and handing bolts, wrenches, and other equipment and my love for car just kept on growing from there and now I have started working on my own car and I really do enjoy working on it, not everybody might not like working on it, getting a little bit dirty but I dont care at all its my own car I get to change parts with even better parts or better looking parts and im proud to call my car my own.</p>
      <p>Trying out new food can be a bit scarry because people worry about what if its expensive and its not that great or its too far from home I dont want to make the drive or even just want to eat food you know you will enjoy, but to me its just about descovering new foods yes sometimes the food isnt that amazing as I hoped for but its just the thrill of descovering the food and actually being able to say that I tried it out and knowing about more food makes me more confident on going to more restaurants because they might have similar food and since I tried it out at a different location the food is unique because each person makes it different and it can be good.</p>

      <h2>Avatar</h2>
      <p>My avatar is a representation of my interests and personality. It features a car, which symbolizes my passion for working on vehicles, and a plate of food, representing my love for trying new cuisines. The background is a blend of colors that reflect my vibrant personality.</p>
      <p>My avatar is "The Violet Piston drive"</p>
      <p>The reason why I chose "The Violet Piston Drive" is because piston is a car part obvously and drive because of drive-thru I was thinking that the name is just a mesh of most of the things I like but Its the main things I like to do but also purple is my favorite color and the reason why I chose the name violet over purple is just that it just sound better and it rolled off the toungue better. </p>

      <h2>Web Development Journey</h2>
      <p>I have chosen Web Development was because it is a class I need for my associates degree and I have always wanted to learn how to make a website and I thought this was the perfect opportunity to do so. It has always been interesting on how websites were made and itll be pretty cool to make a website about cars that I enjoy and would like to share my interest to other car enthusiast.</p>
